			<h3> Context</h3>
			<p>
			The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, and the third in 2015. The World Happiness Report 2016 Update, which ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, was released today in Rome in advance of UN World Happiness Day, March 20th. Leading experts across fields (economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more) describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. They reflect a new worldwide demand for more attention to happiness as a criteria for government policy.

			<h3>Content</h3>
			<p>
			The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2015 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors (economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity) contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world's lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

			<h3>Usage</h3>
			<h4> World map</h4>
			<p> The worldmap gives an Mercator overview of all the country's hapiness scores. If you hover a country it will show the hapiness score based on the cantril ladder explained in paragraph content. </p>
			
			<h4> Scatter plot</h4>
			<p> The Scatter plot gives an overview of the happiness score of each country relative to their  trust in the government. If you hover over a dot it will show the happiness score of that specific country. The dot is also clickable and will highlight a country in the color RED on the World map. If you click on another country the clicked country will highlight in RED and the last country will return to their previous color. The size of the dot depends on the GDP per capita of that country.</p>

			<h4> Economy - GDP per capita</h4>
			<p>
			GDP per capita is in terms of Purchasing
			Power Parity (PPP) adjusted to constant 2011
			international dollars, taken from the World
			Development Indicators (WDI) released by
			the World Bank in December 2015. See the
			appendix for more details. GDP data for 2015
			are not yet available, so we extend the GDP
			time series from 2014 to 2015 using country-specific
			forecasts of real GDP growth from
			the OECD Economic Outlook No. 98 (Edition
			2015/2) and World Bank's Global Economic
			Prospects (December 2014 release), after adjustment
			for population growth. The equation
			uses the natural log of GDP per capita,
			since that form fits the data significantly better
			than does GDP per capita.
			</p>

			<h4>trust in government</h4>
			<p>
			Perceptions of corruption are the average of
			binary answers to two GWP questions: "Is
			corruption widespread throughout the government
			or not" and "Is corruption widespread
			within businesses or not?" Where data
			for government corruption are missing, the
			perception of business corruption is used as
			the overall corruption-perception measure.
